# Why Souvenirs?

U.S. tourists traveling in Latin America have long brought home objects as remembrances --- and, at times, trophies --- of their travel.  Thinking about which objects were deemed "must-have" souveneirs and by whom, and how those categories changed over time and across space, opens a door into the everyday trafficking in "types" and expectations that helped to shape U.S. thinking about Latin America and Latin Americans (and very much vice versa).

# Tourism and Trade

The United Fruit Company, better known for its expansive agricultural holdings across Central America and the Caribbean basin, also participated actively in U.S. tourism to the region in the early twentieth century.  The company's network of railways, communications grids, and tourist-friendly plantations hosted U.S. tourists who traveled to and from the region on Company steamships.  It was entirely possible to take a Latin American vacation without stepping foot off United Fruit Company property.[^1]

# Tourism in the Caribbean

The Caribbean Basin became a nexus for U.S. tourism in Latin America in the early decades of the twentieth century.  Hand in hand with a rise of U.S. foreign intervention across the region, U.S. tourism found a foothold in many of the same places where U.S. state and economic influence was most prominent.  Tourism sectors in places like <span data-click-image-zoomto="5336,1659,1500,1137">Cuba</span>, <span data-click-image-zoomto="9151,2629,750,569">Puerto Rico</span>, and <span data-click-image-zoomto="6,532,6000,4547">Mexico</span> catered to U.S. appetites and cultural expectations.

# Representation and Pop Culture

Tourism companies and government agencies in the U.S. and in Latin America worked actively to "brand" Latin American destinations to attract travelers.  These images translated into popular culture in the U.S., especially visible in arenas including fashion, music, and film.  Representations of Latin America as exotic, tropical, and sensual became readily legible to U.S. audiences even as they flattened wildly diverse societies within a singular (and inaccurate) vision.  Viewers of films like _Guys and Dolls_ (1955) understood why a slick gangster like Sky Masterson would attempt to seduce a righteous and straight-laced charity worker by taking her to Havanna (as seen in this film clip).

# Convenient Yet Exotic

One of the greatest draws for U.S. tourism in the Caribbean during the mid-twentieth century was geography.  Places like Havanna and San Juan were within easy reach of steamships leaving New York, New Orleans, and other U.S. ports.  By the 1950s, air travel made these destinations even easier to reach, transforming what had been fiarly exclusive, elite getaways into attainable vacation spots for middle class travelers.  Class aspirations in the U.S. often defined a tropical vacation in the Caribbean as a marker of "making it."
